Open Society Foundations is based in New York City, with offices worldwide. According to Forbes, in 2020, George Soros's wealth is estimated to be around 8.3 billion dollars. To learn more about George Soros and his history, see here: How George Soros Got Rich. George Soros was mentored by philosopher Karl Popper who coined the term ""Open Society,"" meaning the opposite of authoritarian dictatorship and in support of democracy. Popper's influence led to Soros eventually creating his foundations to fight for an open democratic society's principles. Due to the amount of money and the vast amount of organizations and causes George Soros supports, he has become a target of conservatives and conspiracy theorists who frequently promote conspiracy theories against him. For example, one conspiracy goes that George Soros was a Nazi, even though he is Jewish, hid from the Nazis, and was a child at the time. Conservatives view anything funded by Soros Negatively. For example, he was accused of alleged election fraud during the 2020 Presidential Election, and anytime there is a protest by the left, he is charged with either funding it or orchestrating it.

theage,The Age (Australia),https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-age-australia/,4,"The Age is a daily newspaper from Melbourne, Australia, founded in 1854 by John and Henry Cooke and Walter Powell. Two years later, they sold the paper to Ebenezer Syme and James McEwan. After Ebenezer passed away, David Syme joined McEwan as a partner. David Syme eventually became the publisher and subsequently became the owner. Due to his managerial practices, The Age became profitable and reputable. After the death of David Syme, his sons took control of the paper. Finally, after the last son Oswald Syme passed away, his grandson Ranald Macdonald took control and appointed Graham Perkin as editor-in-chief. Under their management, The Age became the most influential paper of its time. The Australian Dictionary of Biography (maintained by the Australian National University – ANU) states, ""Perkin turned The Age into a more interventionist and campaigning newspaper. It exposed financial scandals in State governments and corruption in the police force and attacked Federal governments for suppressing information. In the process, it attracted critics who thought it too 'leftist.'"" In 1972, John Fairfax Holdings started buying stock in Age publisher David Syme & Co, and eventually, Fairfax took over David Syme & Co completely by the early '80s. As a result, Ranald Macdonald stepped down and was replaced by Greg Taylor. In 2018, Nine Entertainment Co. and Fairfax announced that they would be merging, resulting in Nine shareholders retaining 51 percent ownership. The current editor is Gay Alcorn.

The current president is Carolyn D. Meadows, and the executive vice president is Wayne LaPierre. As of 2018, the NRA claims 5 million members, though this has not been verified. According to their about page, they state ""While widely recognized today as a major political force and as America's foremost defender of Second Amendment rights, the NRA has, since its inception, been the premier firearms education organization in the world."" Investigations by the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller resulted in indictments of Russian agents on charges of developing and exploiting ties with the NRA to influence US politics. The deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia, Aleksandr Torshin, is suspected of illegally funneling money through the NRA to benefit Trump's 2016 campaign. In May 2018, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee released a report stating it had obtained ""a number of documents that suggest the Kremlin used the National Rifle Association as a means of accessing and assisting Mr. Trump and his campaign"" through Torshin and his assistant Maria Butina, and that ""The Kremlin may also have used the NRA to fund Mr. Trump's campaign secretly."" In 2019, the NRA faced numerous controversies that you can read about here.
